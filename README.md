This repository contains the projects completed by MOUSTERI MARIA ELENI as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

## Projects

As part of this certification, I successfully completed the following projects and ensured that all automated test suites passed:

1. **Palindrome Checker**: A JavaScript program to check if a given string is a palindrome.

2. **Roman Numeral Converter**: A JavaScript program that converts Roman numerals to decimal numbers.

3. **Caesars Cipher**: A JavaScript program that implements the Caesar cipher for text encryption and decryption.

4. **Telephone Number Validator**: A JavaScript program to validate if a given string is a valid US telephone number.

5. **Cash Register**: A JavaScript program that acts as a cash register, providing change for a purchase with different denominations of currency.

Each project represents a practical application of JavaScript and demonstrates my proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving.

Feel free to explore each project's directory for the source code and documentation.
